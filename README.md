# Word Ladder Game in C++

## Overview

This project implements a console-based word ladder game in C++, where players transform one word into another by changing a single letter at a time. Each intermediate word must be a valid dictionary word. The game supports both automatic and interactive game modes and includes user analytics saved in `.csv` files.

## Features

* **Graph Construction**:

  * Words are represented as nodes.
  * Edges connect words differing by one letter.
  * Graphs are generated by word length.

* **Game Modes**:

  * **Automatic Mode**: Enter a start and target word and see the shortest transformation path.
  * **Playing Mode**: User is given a random start and target word to solve manually, with optional hints.
  * **Analytics Mode**: Displays gameplay statistics (games played, unique words used, total hints) from a `.csv` file.

* **Hints System**:

  * Provides the next correct word in the optimal path.
  * Highlights the changed character in red using ANSI escape codes.

* **Persistent Storage**:

  * User history is saved in a CSV file including start/target words, hints used, user path, and optimal path.

## Technical Highlights

* File I/O (CSV logging, dictionary loading)
* Dynamic memory and STL containers (`map`, `vector`, `set`, `queue`)
* Breadth-First Search for shortest path calculation
* Graph data structure with adjacency lists
* Random word generation using `<random>`
* Colorized terminal output (using ANSI codes)

## How to Use

1. **Prepare Dictionary**

   * Provide a text file where each line is a valid word.

2. **Compile**

   * Use a C++ compiler with C++11 or newer.
   * Example with g++:

     ```
     g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp game.cpp -o wordladder
     ```

3. **Run the Game**

   ```
   ./wordladder
   ```

4. **Choose Game Mode**

   * Automatic transformation (manual input)
   * User plays to guess the ladder
   * Analytics for user gameplay stats

## Project Structure

* `main.cpp` — Entry point and menu navigation
* `game.h` / `game.cpp` — Game logic and modes
* `graph.h` / `graph.cpp` — Generic graph implementation
* `dictionary.txt` — List of valid words (required input)
* `<username>.csv` — Saved analytics per user
